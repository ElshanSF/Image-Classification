# Image-Classification
In this project, we aim to classify images of handwritten digits. 

The data set is provided in the file `dataset_1.txt` and contains 8x8 gray-scale images of hand-written digits flattened to a 64-length vector. The last column contains the digit. We have only included digits 0, 1, and 3 for simplicity. 

We want to build a model that can be given the image of a hand-written digit and correctly classify this digit as 0, 1, or 3.
